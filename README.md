# What is it about ?

From 1987 to 1992, John Cage wrote a series of scores named the *''Number Pieces''*, which use in almost all of them a particular time-structure, called *''time-bracket''* for determining the temporal location of sounds.

With these indetermined scores, performers determine the location and duration of sounds by choosing their starting and ending times according to the specific rules of the time-bracket system. The superposition of different voices each performing time-brackets creates a polyphonic landscape in constant evolution.

We present here a javascript-based web interface for the interactive interpretation of John Cage's Five<sup>5</sup>. The starting and ending times are drawn at random according to the user-defined probability distributions inside their corresponding time intervals. Leveraging the possibilities of the Web Audio API, one can then listen to such a realization.
